I'm an aspiring web developer who's been self-learning for a while, I quit for a bit, but when I remembered how much fun I had coding, I came back and I've been at it ever since.

I enjoy anime, programming and working with others. Nothing brings me more joy than having others view and or use what I make. I'm kind of a dweeb, thus my projects reflect that. Have fun and look around!
